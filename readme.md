Serverless[^1] calendar written in Typescript for Deno Deploy, inspired by the [zerocal project](https://endler.dev/2022/zerocal/).

## The name
Why the name kiwi? My thinking went like this: *"Calendar... I use the Thunderbird calendar... Thunderbird is a flightless bird. Zero is like 'flightless'. Kiwis are also flightless."*

## Built with
